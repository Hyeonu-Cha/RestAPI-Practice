What is SOLID?
S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - Every class should have one, and only one, job.
O - Open/Closed Principle - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
L - Liskov Substitution Principle - If you have a class that uses an interface, it should be able to work with any object that implements that interface without breaking.
I - Interface Segregation Principle - It's better to have many small, specific interfaces than one big, general-purpose interface.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
